A stunning, manga-inspired project page for the ICCV 2025 paper on evaluating Vision Language Models' understanding of sequential visual storytelling.

## 🏆 Award Recognition

- **ICCV 2025 Oral Presentation**
- **Best Paper Award Nominee**

## 🎨 Design Features

This project page features an elegant **manga art style** with:

- **Black and white color scheme** with brownish vignette effects
- **Old book page aesthetic** with sepia tones
- **Manga-style UI elements** including speech bubbles and panel borders
- **Smooth animations** and hover effects
- **Responsive design** for all device sizes

## 📚 Paper Overview

Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing sequential visual storytelling. This work introduces a novel evaluation framework for manga narrative understanding, revealing fundamental limitations in current VLMs' story-level intelligence.

### Key Contributions

1. **Novel Evaluation Framework**: Fine-grained multimodal annotation protocol
2. **Comprehensive Dataset**: Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters with 308 annotated pages  
3. **Systematic Analysis**: Three-axis evaluation (storytelling, dialogue grounding, temporal reasoning)
4. **Critical Insights**: Reveals gaps in temporal causality and character consistency

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🎯 Key Findings

- VLMs excel at individual panel interpretation but fail at cross-panel cohesion
- Systematic failures in temporal causality and narrative reasoning
- Struggles with non-linear narratives and character consistency
- Current models lack genuine story-level intelligence
